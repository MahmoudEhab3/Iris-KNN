#Iris KNN Classifier

This project is a simple implementation of the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm using Python. It applies KNN to classify flowers from the famous Iris dataset based on their sepal and petal dimensions. The goal is to compare how different distance metrics impact the accuracy of the predictions.

About the Dataset

The Iris dataset contains 150 samples from three different species of iris flowers:

Setosa

Versicolor

Virginica

Each sample has four features:

Sepal Length

Sepal Width

Petal Length

Petal Width

What This Project Does

Data Visualization: It uses Seaborn to create scatter plots that display the relationships between sepal and petal dimensions for each species.

KNN Implementation: A custom KNN classifier is implemented to predict flower species using three distance metrics:

Cosine Similarity

Euclidean Distance

Manhattan Distance

Performance Evaluation: It calculates and prints accuracy, as well as the number of correct and incorrect predictions for each metric.
